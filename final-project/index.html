                <h2> Shuttle-UM </h2>
                <h3> By: Benjamin Gonzalez <h3>

                [Photo of a Shuttle-UM shuttle to open the story]

                <p>Shortly after 11 p.m. on a cold and calm Thursday night in February, a Green Line shuttle arrived at the La Plata bus stop. On board were about 20 women all dressed in black and a few more passengers distinctly separate from the large party. One of the women wearing black began to sing, and, as the other women joined in, the bus became of a cacophony of sound. The bus driver smiled.</p>

                <p>Scenes like this one are not uncommon on a late-night weekend shuttle heading toward the bars on Baltimore Avenue - traditionally, Thursday is part of the weekend for college students. Also not uncommon are buses so full of passengers that their drivers can only stop to let people off, no longer accepting new riders. This culture of bus riding is relatively new to the University of Maryland, founded in 1856.</p>

                <p>"Shuttle-UM was started in 1972 by members of the Black Student Union, in response to a rash of nighttime assaults on campus," <a href="https://umdarchives.wordpress.com/2012/11/24/shuttle-um-and-the-black-student-union">according to an excerpt from the Shuttle-UM Driver Handbook quoted by Terrapin Tales</a>, the UMD Archives blog. In its first year, the service "consisted of four vans and three routes, with a yearly ridership of 65,000 [people]," according to Terrapin Tales. Shuttle-UM now has a fleet of over 75 vehicles and a yearly ridership of over 2.6 million, according to UMD's <a href="https://transportation.umd.edu/shuttle-um">Department Transportation Services</a> (UMD DOTS).</p>

                <p>Clara Fleck Plewinski, assistant director of marketing and communication for UMD DOTS, noted that the ridership figures do not represent unique riders, just unique trips for each rider. The ridership numbers still show the massive popularity of the shuttles as a service within the Maryland community, but there are some routes that make up the majority of rides.
                In fiscal year 2019, Shuttle-UM had over 3.2 million riders, and its most popular routes were the 104, 105, 122, 115 and 117. These five routes, which cover the campus, Baltimore Avenue and the College Park Metro Station, comprise over 56% of the entire annual ridership of Shuttle-UM.</p>

                <p>The 104 route is a daily service between the UMD campus and the College Park Metro Station. In May of 2018 the route had its weekend service cut due to a budget shortfall, <a href="https://www.dbknews.com/2018/07/17/umd-dots-shuttle-bus-route-college-park-metro-cuts-funding-athletic-department/">according to The Diamondback</a>, but by mid-July its service was reinstated.</p>

                <p>A new challenge for the 104 bus route: the Purple Line being added to the Metro system, which will connect to the College Park Metro. It is that link to off-campus and beyond that makes Shuttle-UM so valuable to some.</p>

                <p>Other less popular routes play an important role in decision-making for UMD students, especially when it comes to making housing choices. Abby Warshowsky, a 1984 alumna of the university, recalled the influence that having a shuttle service had on her time at UMD.</p>

                 <p>"When I moved off-campus, I looked for a space on the shuttle route because my roommate didn't have a car," Warshowsky said. "Funny thing was that if I took the shuttle, it was faster because my parking was so far."</p>

                <p>Providing the shuttle service is no cheap endeavor, though. In their 2017-2018 annual report, UMD DOTS reported a total expenditure of $10.2 million and a total revenue of $10.8 million for fiscal year 2019. Although these numbers are estimates, the actual figures for the years 2014-2018 showed that the revenue was greater than the expenditures.</p>

                <p>Whether it is used for commuting from off-campus, for avoiding a long walk across UMD or for fun on the proverbial weekend, Shuttle-UM service has been a part of UMD for nearly 50 years and will continue to be an essential mode of transportation for years to come.</p>
