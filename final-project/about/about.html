            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Proud 956-er. I was born in the Bronx, New York, but I was raised in the Rio Grande Valley. The RGV, as locals call it, is a region unlike any other I have visited. Although summers were dreadfully hot and humid, I always looked forward to them because I could get "raspas," or sno-cones. </p>

            <p>As one of the only Jewish, non-Mexican Hispanics - I'm Salvadoran - in school growing up, I did my best to answer the many questions I inevitably got about my intersectional identity. The region and my identity have both hugely influenced my journalistic passions. I would like to report on underreprsented and underacknowledged people and groups.</p>
